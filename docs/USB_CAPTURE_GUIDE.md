# USB Capture Guide for Logitech Wheel Protocol Analysis

This guide explains how to capture USB traffic between G Hub and your Logitech wheel on Windows. These captures help us reverse-engineer FFB protocols for Linux driver development.

**Target devices:** Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel (046d:c272) and other unsupported wheels.

## What We Need

To add FFB support for a new wheel, we need captures showing:

1. **Device initialization** - What happens when G Hub starts
2. **FFB during gameplay** - The actual force feedback commands
3. **Settings changes** - Rotation range, FFB strength, damping, etc.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 with Logitech G Hub installed
- Wireshark with USBPcap (https://www.wireshark.org/)
- Your Logitech wheel connected via USB
- A game with force feedback (any racing game works)

## Installation

1. Download Wireshark from https://www.wireshark.org/download.html
2. During installation, check the box to install **USBPcap**
3. Reboot after installation

## Finding Your Device

1. Open Device Manager (Win+X -> Device Manager)
2. Expand "Human Interface Devices"
3. Find your wheel (e.g., "Logitech G Pro Racing Wheel")
4. Note which USB root hub it's connected to

Or use USBPcap's command line:
```
USBPcapCMD.exe
```
This lists all USB devices and their bus numbers.

## Capture Procedure

### Capture 1: G Hub Initialization

This shows feature discovery and initial device setup.

1. Close G Hub completely (system tray -> right-click -> Quit)
2. Start Wireshark
3. Select the USBPcap interface for your wheel's USB bus
4. Start capture
5. Launch G Hub
6. Wait for G Hub to fully connect to the wheel (settings page loads)
7. Stop capture
8. Save as: `ghub_init_[device].pcapng`

### Capture 2: FFB Gameplay

This shows the actual force feedback protocol.

1. Start Wireshark capture
2. Launch a racing game with FFB support
3. Play for 30-60 seconds with varied inputs:
   - Drive straight
   - Turn left and right
   - Hit curbs/rumble strips
   - Collide with something
4. Stop capture
5. Save as: `ffb_gameplay_[device].pcapng`

### Capture 3: Settings Sweep

This shows the HID++ commands for each setting.

For each setting below, do one capture:
1. Start capture
2. In G Hub, slowly drag the slider from min to max
3. Stop capture
4. Save with descriptive name

**Settings to capture:**
- `rotation_range_[device].pcapng` - Rotation range (e.g., 360 -> 900 -> 1080)
- `ffb_strength_[device].pcapng` - FFB strength slider
- `damping_[device].pcapng` - Damping slider (if present)
- `trueforce_[device].pcapng` - TRUEFORCE slider (if present)

### Capture 4: Cold Boot (Optional but Valuable)

Shows what the wheel does before G Hub loads.

1. Unplug wheel
2. Close G Hub
3. Start Wireshark capture
4. Plug in wheel
5. Wait 10 seconds (capture raw USB enumeration)
6. Start G Hub
7. Wait for connection
8. Stop capture
9. Save as: `cold_boot_[device].pcapng`

## Wireshark Filter Tips

To isolate your wheel's traffic:
```
usb.idVendor == 0x046d && usb.idProduct == 0xc272
```
(Replace `0xc272` with your wheel's product ID)

To see only outgoing data (host to device):
```
usb.dst == "X.Y.Z"
```
(Replace with your device address from the capture)

## What Makes a Good Capture

- **Start clean**: Close G Hub before starting capture, then launch it
- **Isolate actions**: One setting change per capture file
- **Label clearly**: Include device name and action in filename
- **Include context**: Note what game you used, what actions you performed

## Submitting Captures

1. Create a GitHub issue at: https://github.com/mescon/logitech-rs50-linux-driver/issues
2. Title: "USB captures for [Device Name]"
3. Attach your capture files (or link to cloud storage if too large)
4. Include:
   - Device name and USB ID (from Device Manager)
   - G Hub version
   - Brief description of each capture file

## Privacy Note

USB captures may contain:
- Your Windows username (in USB device paths)
- Timestamps

They do NOT contain:
- Network traffic
- File contents
- Passwords

If concerned, you can scrub captures with Wireshark's "Edit -> Preferences -> Name Resolution" settings, or just let us know and we'll treat the files as confidential.

## Quick Capture Script

For convenience, save this as `capture_ffb.bat` and run from an admin command prompt:

```batch
@echo off
setlocal

REM === Configuration ===
set DEVICE_NAME=gpro
set USB_BUS=2
set CAPTURE_DIR=%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\wheel_captures

REM === Setup ===
mkdir "%CAPTURE_DIR%" 2>nul
cd /d "%ProgramFiles%\USBPcap"

## Technical Background

### What we're looking for

**For the G Pro Wheel specifically**, we need to determine:

1. **USB Interface Structure**
   - How many interfaces does it present?
   - Which interface handles FFB?

2. **FFB Command Format**
   - Does it use HID++ Feature 0x8123 (like G920/G923)?
   - Or dedicated USB endpoints (like RS50)?
   - What's the report format?

3. **Force Value Encoding**
   - Signed vs unsigned
   - Offset binary vs two's complement
   - Resolution (8-bit, 16-bit?)

### Reference: RS50 FFB Architecture

The RS50 uses dedicated endpoints, NOT HID++ for FFB:
- Interface 2, Endpoint 0x03 OUT
- 64-byte reports
- Format: `01 00 00 00 01 [seq] [force_lo] [force_hi] [force_lo] [force_hi] ...`

The G920/G923 use HID++ Feature 0x8123 for FFB commands.

The G Pro is a direct-drive wheel like the RS50, so it might use either approach.
